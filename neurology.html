            <img src="https://www.sharda.ac.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/What-is-Neurology-and-how-to-Build-Career.jpg" height="60%" width="100%"> Institute of Neurosciences is regarded as one of the best neurology and neurosurgery hospital in India with a legacy of innovation and excellence.

            Ably assisted by the latest Neuro-Radiology services, Neuro-Intensive Care facilities and Medical and Radiation Oncology services, our Neurologists and Neurosurgeons achieve outcomes in neurological disease & treatments matching those of the leading institutions across the globe.
            
            The department of neurosurgery at Apollo Hospitals in India is well equipped to treat all the neurological diseases including 
            stroke
            , headache, epilepsy, coma, neuropathies, multiple sclerosis, myopathies, Parkinson’s disease, Myasthenia Gravis and many more, establishing it as one of the best hospital for 
            neurosurgery treatment in India
            .
            
            Neurosurgery a branch of surgery involved with the brain injury, spine and nerves, is a key specialty at Apollo hospitals. Our neurosurgery doctors treat neurological diseases such as brain injury or diseases, head injury, spinal injury, brain tumors, spinal tumors, brain hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, nerve injuries, tumors, disc prolapse or herniation, spinal dislocation, unstable spine, congenital malformations like atlanto-axial dislocation, spinal dysraphism etc. Treatment of seizures or epilepsy as well as modern treatments for movement disorders like 
            Parkinson’s disease
             are further specializations. More than 1000 major neurosurgeries are being carried out every year.
            
            Our neurologists will check for complex neurology diseases and conditions of the patient and provide treatment based on the observation.
            
            Today, Neuroanaesthesia, Neurosurgical intensive care and Neuro-imaging technology have advanced so much that mortality has significantly reduced and functional outcomes have improved tremendously. Minimally invasive techniques help decrease the mortality and morbidity associated with surgery.
            
            With a team led by some of the best neurosurgeons in India, preservation of all functions, good cosmetic outcome, shorter hospital stay and avoiding pain and discomfort are considered as important as saving a patient’s life. The integrated team of neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuroanesthetists, neuro physicians and intensivists along with rehabilitation specialists are dedicated to this goal.
