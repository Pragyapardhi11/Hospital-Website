      <p><h2><strong><i>SANJEEVANI CARE Hospital was founded on December 1, 1974. It was a time when no health care facilities were available in villages and no awareness of health care programmes were present. In the beginning stages the reverend sisters and doctors went to the villages and conducted many medical camps, supplied free medicines and tried to make them aware of the importance of health and dignity of human life. Thousands of patients in the villages were cured due to the selfless service of the doctors, unconditional commitment of the reverend sisters and nurses and the hospital began to be known far and wide. The hospital always led by a clear vision and mission and value system. His Excellency John Perumattam, Rev Fr John Plakeel took the initiative to start a hospital to serve the poor in the village.</i></strong></h2></p>
